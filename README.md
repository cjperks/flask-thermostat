# flask-thermostat

Updated version of the original Django based home thermostat.
Rewritten in Flask as the Django was much larger than required.
Added simple pages for altering the schedule and viewing statistics.
Stats page doesn't want to be displayed by default as this is supposed to work on a Raspberry Pi Zero.
